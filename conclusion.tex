\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
This paper presents a new algorithm that correctly encodes MPI point-to-point communication and MPI collective communication. The encoding supports both infinite buffer semantics and zero buffer semantics. To constrain the behavior of message communication, the encoding directly uses match pairs over sends and receives. The partial order over events is also constrained according to the MPI semantics. In particular, the zero buffer encoding is further capable of detecting whether an MPI execution is compatible with zero buffer semantics. Experiments demonstrate that the new encoding is correct. Also, the salability test shows that the new encoding is able to scale to a massive number of non-deterministic choices of send-receive matches. Finally, a few benchmark program tests demonstrate that the new encoding is able to efficiently detect the violation and is useful to check zero buffer compatibility. 

The encoding is dependent on an input execution trace of the program. Future work explores using bounded model checking technique to encode an MPI program instead of an execution trace including branches and loops. This technique statically unrolls an MPI program and then verify it by constraining the semantics into an SMT encoding. Finally, since the encoding in this paper does not constrain the computation in a program, future work explores encoding it correctly.
