\section{Experiments}
We launch three series of experiments to test our new encoding: a correctness test on the running examples presented in this paper, a scalability test on the effects of message non-determinism, and a typical benchmark test on several programs. All the results show the comparison between the zero-buffer encoding and the infinite-buffer encoding.  Those experiments were run on a 2.40 GHz Intel Quad Core processor with 8 GB memory running Windows 7. We set a time limit of 2 hours for each test. We abort the verification process if it did not complete within the time-limit. 

The initial program trace is generated by running MPICH \cite{}, a publicly prevalent implementation of MPI standard, with fixed input. The experiments only consider one path of the control flow through the program. Complete coverage of the program for verification purposes would need to generate input to exercise different control flow paths.
