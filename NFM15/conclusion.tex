\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
This paper presents a new algorithm that correctly encodes a single-path MPI program for both infinite buffer semantics and zero buffer semantics into an SMT problem. This encoding, including the rules for MPI point-to-point communication and MPI collective communication, is capable of detecting zero buffer incompatibility. Though the zero buffer encoding considers only the schedules that strictly alternate sends and receives, the message communication that may occur in any execution for zero buffer semantics is covered. Experiments demonstrate that the new encoding is correct and more efficient than two state-of-art MPI verifiers. 

The encoding is dependent on a single-path MPI program which can be initialized by an execution trace. Future work will explore using bounded model checking to encode all the paths of an MPI program. This technique statically unrolls an MPI program and then verifies it by constraining the semantics into an SMT encoding. Also, future work will explore using SMT technique to check deadlock patterns other than zero buffer incompatibility.
