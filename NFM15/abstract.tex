A prevalent asynchronous message passing standard is the Message Passing Interface (MPI). 
%
There are two runtime semantics for MPI: zero buffer (messages have no buffering) and infinite buffer (messages are copied into a runtime buffer on the API call).
%
A problem in any MPI program, intended or otherwise, is zero buffer incompatibility. A zero buffer incompatible MPI program deadlocks.
%
This problem is difficult to predict because a developer does not know if the deadlock is based on the buffering semantics or a bad program. 
%
This paper presents an algorithm that encodes a single-path MPI program as a Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) problem, which if satisfiable, yields a feasible schedule, such that it proves the program is zero buffer compatible. This encoding is also adaptable to checking assertion violation for correct computation.
%
To support MPI semantics, this algorithm correctly defines the point-to-point communication and collective communication with respective rules for both infinite buffer semantics and zero buffer semantics. 
%
The novelty in this paper is considering only the schedules that strictly alternate sends and receives leading to an intuitive zero buffer encoding.
%
This paper proves that the set of all the strictly alternating schedules is capable of covering all the message communication that may occur in any execution under zero buffer semantics. 
%
Experiments demonstrate that the SMT encoding is correct and highly efficient for a set of benchmarks compared with two state-of-art MPI verifiers.
