\section{Extension to MPI Semantics}
This section discusses the new encoding for MPI deterministic point-to-point communication and collective communication. To be precise, the encoding needs to add variables  $src_\mathtt{S}$ and $src_\mathtt{R}$ to the send operation and the receive operation respectively. Intuitively, the variables $src_\mathtt{S}$ and $src_\mathtt{R}$ are the source endpoints of messages. As such, a send operation $\mathtt{S}$ $=$ $(M_\mathtt{S},$ $\mathit{time}_\mathtt{S},$ $e_\mathtt{S},$ $src_\mathtt{S},$ $\mathit{value}_\mathtt{S})$,  is now a five-tuple of variables. A receive operation $\mathtt{R}$ $=$ $(M_\mathtt{R},$ $\mathit{time}_\mathtt{R},$ $e_\mathtt{R},$ $src_\mathtt{R},$ $\mathit{value}_\mathtt{R},$ $\mathit{time}_{\mathtt{W}_\mathtt{R}})$, is now a six-tuple of variables. We constrain the variable $src_\mathtt{R}$ to be equal to $\ast$ for a wildcard receive $\mathtt{R}$. In addition, the match pair defined in \defref{def:match} adds a new constraint: 
\[
src_\mathtt{R} = \ast \vee src_\mathtt{S} = src_\mathtt{R}, 
\]
indicating that either $\mathtt{R}$ is a wildcard receive or the source endpoints are matched for $\mathtt{S}$ and $\mathtt{R}$.
